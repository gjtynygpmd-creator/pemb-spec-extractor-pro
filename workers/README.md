# Processing Worker

The active worker now lives at `backend/app/worker.py` so the API and worker share the same models, configuration, and dependencies.

Run locally from `backend/`:

```bash
python -m app.worker
```

Deploy on Render as a Background Worker using the same environment variables as the API.
